rc-patches v0.3.2

bring on the bump using your favorite minimal object-oriented algorithmic balls

Originally begun at a STEIM residency in October 2007, these patches are inspired by Chris McCormick's awesome s-abstractions and Frank Barknecht's sssad state saving.  Most of the objects have guis with sssad state saveable parameters.

You will need pd-extended and sssad (included).

patches

Some of the objects included are:

    * rc-drumsseqs: sequencers with velocity values
    * rc-patternbuddy: pattern save and load to sequencers
    * rc-chipwave~: a chiptunes emulator built around Phill Phelp's chipwave~ example
    * rc-wavetable~: a wavetable gui osc
    * rc-sample~: oneshot sampler with reverse and speed control
    * rc-arp: the arpeggiator from Tod Winkler's Composing Interactive Music
    * rc-openclose: open and close patches (useful for playlists)
    * rc-count: yet another counter (no pd external is complete without one)
    * a bunch of utility wrappers (sfplay~, rc-spigot~, etc)
    * blahblahblah ... the list grows

LAYOUT
------

The rc lib is focused on pd-vanilla / rjlib in order for the majority of patches to work in [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd).

You will need to have the [rjlib](https://github.com/rjdj/rjlib) installed and added to your path. Get it from here: <https://github.com/rjdj/rjlib>

**rc**: the new robotcowboy lib, following the rjlib model

**extra**: patches which require externals (aka pd-extended)

### Deprecated

These are the old rc-patches for Pd-extended, 2008-2013. Most, if not all of this functionality has been rewritten in **rc**.

**rc-patches**: robotcowboy patch library (mostly rewritten into the rc lib)

**gm-patches**: general midi helpers (rewritten into the rc lib)

**rc-drums**: 808 drum emulation (rewritten into the rc lib)

**wip-patches**: (old) bleeding edge work in progress patches (not cleaned)
